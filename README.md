Notes and good info from books I've read are stored here for reference and sharing. Most are related to development, although some are from more general non-fiction that I find useful.

Each is in markdown with some basic info on the book followed by an outline of all the important info. I update this repo even while many notes are still outlines or I'm still reading the material, so some will be unfinished.
This practice helps me cut the noise and focus on signals I get while reading something worthwhile.
